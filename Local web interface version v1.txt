Thinking: The user is asking how to restart their V2 deployment on Render if it goes down. They also see their local V1 server is running but unsecured (no password set).
Let me clarify the difference - V2 on Render should have the password set via environment variables. The warning they're seeing is from their local V1 server, not the V2 deployment.
For restarting V2 on Render:
1. Go to render.com
2. Find the assistant service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" or just wait for auto-deploy
4. Or restart the service
Let me provide clear instructions.
That warning is from your local V1 server (on your laptop), not the V2 deployment on Render.

To restart V2 on Render:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your assistant service
3. Click Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit
Or simply push a new commit to GitHub and Render will auto-deploy.

To secure your local V1 (optional):
set OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
opencode web --port 5173

Your V2 at https://assistant-c8k0.onrender.com/ is running on Render's cloud and is separate from your local server
